# Jaylib - JNI bindings for [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/)

JNI is the fastest kind of native binding for Java, but is difficult to write.  Therefore
we are using [JavaCPP](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp) to automatically generate the bindings.
The results are not quite as Java-like
as you would get from a hand-written binding, but they are not bad, and should be easy to keep up to date
with the latest changes in Raylib.

JavaCPP is very mature and powerful but not hugely documented, so it is probably capable of doing more than we are
doing so far.
See [issues](https://github.com/electronstudio/jaylib/issues).

# Status

All functions from Raylib 3.0 are available on Linux, Mac and Windows (64 bit only).  It works for me, but has not been
put into production anywhere yet.

If there is a newer version of Raylib out then you can probably re-generate these bindings with little or no changes, because
they are auto-generated.  See [How To Build](#how-to-build)

## How to use

Download the latest [jaylib.jar](https://github.com/electronstudio/jaylib/releases/download/v3.0.0-rc5/jaylib.jar) from [releases](https://github.com/electronstudio/jaylib/releases)

Write a demo program, e.g. Demo.java

```java
import com.raylib.Jaylib.Vector3;
import com.raylib.Jaylib.Camera;
import com.raylib.Raylib;
import static com.raylib.Jaylib.*;

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        InitWindow(800, 450, "Demo");
        SetTargetFPS(60);
        Camera camera = new Camera(new Vector3(18,16,18),new Vector3(), new Vector3(0,1,0), 45, 0);
        SetCameraMode(camera, CAMERA_ORBITAL);

        while(!WindowShouldClose()){
            UpdateCamera(camera);
            BeginDrawing();
            ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);
            BeginMode3D(camera);
            DrawGrid(20, 1.0f);
            EndMode3D();
            DrawText("Hello world", 190, 200, 20, VIOLET);
            DrawFPS(20, 20);
            EndDrawing();
        }
        Raylib.CloseWindow();
    }
}
```

Compile and run it:

    java -cp jaylib.jar Demo.java
    
On MacOS you need this option:

    java -XstartOnFirstThread -cp jaylib.jar Demo.java
    
## How to build

Edit src/com/raylib/RaylibConfig.java.  Change the paths to the correct directories on your system.  (Yes, you would think JavaCPP could work this out for itself, or that relative paths could be used, but it seems not to work.)

Run:
`./build.sh`

This will build you a jaylib.jar uber-jar.

On Windows the script must be run from inside a Visual C 2015 native x64 command prompt, and needs git-bash to be installed.

## License

Jaylib is distributed under the GPL license with the Classpath Exception to allow linking, the same as OpenJDK itself, so you can use it
anywhere that you use the JDK, for both free and non-free ('closed source') projects.
